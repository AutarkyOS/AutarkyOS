//! Putting a staged image where the boot hook will find it.
//!
//! `hook` runs before `ExitBootServices` and applies whatever is staged, using
//! the firmware's own FAT driver. This is the other end: writing those files
//! from a kernel that is already running, through our FAT writer, over NVMe.
//!
//! ### The gate stays ranged
//!
//! NVMe writes are locked until somebody claims a range, and nothing here
//! lifts that further than it has to: the claim covers the boot partition's
//! LBA window and is dropped again on every path out, including the ones that
//! failed halfway. An updater built on a global unlock is a whole-disk writer
//! that happens to be aiming carefully, and it only has to miss once.
//!
//! ### Finding the right volume, not the first one
//!
//! "The first partition that parses as FAT" is the right default for a person
//! browsing a disk and the wrong one for this. Writing three files to
//! somebody's data volume and reporting success is the worst outcome available
//! here -- it would look exactly like an update that worked, until the next
//! boot changed nothing. So the volume has to carry `\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI`
//! before it is written to.
