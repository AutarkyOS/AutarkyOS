//! The stored tree, read without restoring it.
//!
//! Everything else in `sysbox` works on the **working tree**, which is
//! `Node::Blob(Vec<u8>)` all the way down and therefore entirely resident.
//! That is right for a namespace and wrong for a corpus: `read_node` walks
//! every node at restore and SHA-256s every blob, so a forest that fits on
//! disk and not in memory cannot be reached at all.
//!
//! This is the other door. It resolves a path by walking **directory chunks
//! only**, and reads bytes out of a blob's chunk with `cas::read_blocks` --
//! which has been sitting in the tree, finished, with nothing calling it.
//!
//! ### The two trades, which are different for directories and for blobs
//!
//! A directory chunk is read with `Store::get`: small, verified against its
//! own address, and there are few of them. A blob is read with `read_blocks`:
//! ranged, allocation-free, and **unverified**, because the hash covers the
//! whole blob and a range is not the whole blob. `cas.rs` says so where the
//! function is declared. So a body read this way is trusted on the strength of
//! having been verified when it was imported, which is the trade streaming
//! always makes and the reason the index is built from paths the directory
//! walk produced rather than from anything a body claims about itself.
//!
//! ### One scratch buffer, which is the fix `cas::dma` asks for
//!
//! `cas::dma` allocates per call through `alloc_zeroed` and never frees --
//! measured at 4,096 bytes plus the rounded length per blob. Its own note says
//! one static scratch would serve every caller. This is that, narrowed to the
//! callers here: 64 KiB taken the first time somebody asks and reused for the
//! life of the boot, so a million ranged reads cost what one does.
//!
//! It is **not reentrant**, which is the same bargain `Racy` makes and is
//! stated for the same reason: one core, one caller at a time, and nothing
//! here may be reached from an interrupt.
