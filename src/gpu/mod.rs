//! Does this machine have a GPU, and will it answer?
//!
//! Nothing in this kernel has ever spoken to the graphics card. `src/gfx` is a
//! linear framebuffer that UEFI handed over before `ExitBootServices`, and on
//! this laptop that framebuffer belongs to the Intel part; the discrete NVIDIA
//! chip drives no display at all and has sat idle since the project began.
//!
//! This module answers the three questions that have to be settled before any
//! of that can change, in the order that lets each one end the enquiry:
//!
//!   1. Is the device on the bus? `pci::scan` already sweeps every function
//!      and already knows 0x10de and class 0x03 by name, so this is a filter
//!      over machinery that was finished before the question was asked.
//!   2. If it is not, is that because it is absent or because it is asleep?
//!      A muxless Optimus laptop parks the discrete GPU in D3cold, where
//!      config space reads 0xFFFF and the device is indistinguishable from one
//!      that was never fitted. `empty_bridges` separates the two cases.
//!   3. If it is there, does MMIO work? NV_PMC_BOOT_0 has lived at offset 0
//!      of BAR0 on every NVIDIA part ever made and encodes the chip id. A
//!      correct answer means the device is alive and addressable from ring 0,
//!      which is the entire question this module exists to settle.
//!
//! Reading a device register is the one genuinely dangerous act here. Every
//! exception vector in this kernel except #BP diverges (`src/cpu/idt.rs`), so
//! a bad MMIO read is a halted machine and a register dump, not an error
//! return. `boot0` therefore refuses on every condition it can name in
//! advance rather than reading and hoping.
